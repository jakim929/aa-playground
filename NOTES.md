# notes: some gotchas along the way

goal is to get bundlers / paymasters working on a local devnet on anvil.


## SenderCreator deployment
`SenderCreator` is initialized when constructing `EntryPoint`, so just doing `vm.etch` with the `EntryPoint` bytecode is insufficient. Need to etch bytecode into the expected location of `SenderCreator`

## Since KernelFactory is stateful, need to create stake for entrypoint
`skandha` doesn't seem to care though? MinStake seems to be 0

## skandha with `aa-sdk` for `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`

`skandha` `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` requires all fields to be present and valid. not sure if that's upt to spec. `aa-sdk` doesn't fill all values (ie. preVerificationGas, callGasLimit). Pretty sure `rundler` doesn't care

## aa-sdk adds weird headers to fetch requests
```
'Alchemy-Aa-Sdk-Signer', 'Alchemy-Aa-Sdk-Factory-Address', 'Alchemy-Aa-Sdk-Version'
```

## rundler doesn't support anvil because tracing doesn't work? 

Think it requires geth - it can't simulate UO so it sendUserOperation fails.

## debug_traceCall issue

- most bundlers require debug_traceCall options to run simulation
- either https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5855 lands
- or run bundler in unsafeMode (without simulation)
    - skandha supports unsafeMode
    - https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler supports --unsafe
    - rundler has one planned https://github.com/alchemyplatform/rundler/issues/470
